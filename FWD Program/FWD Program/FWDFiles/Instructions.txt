RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
*Step 1: Start the program and click "Browse". Navigate to the folder you want the Excel File to be placed.
*Step 2: Click "OK" once folder is highlighted.
*Step 3: The program will open up Access and ask for the FWD database. Choose the FWD database you want analyzed and
	 click "OK"
*Step 4: A Microsoft Access Security Notice might popup many times warning about opening the FWD database. Click "Open"
	 each time the notice appears on screen.
*Step 5: Access will close once it is finished and Excel will open. Excel will ask you what you want the output file
	 named. Enter a filename and click "OK". If the box is left blank, the default filename will be FWDOut.xlsm.
*Step 6: Excel will then ask if you would like to do a maximum displacement threshold check. Clicking "No" will continue
	 the program until it is finished. Clicking "Yes" will then create another popup asking what the maximum threshold
  	 should be flagged at. Enter a number and click OK.
*Step 7: Excel will close and a message will tell you that the Excel file is ready for viewing.


TROUBLESHOOTING:
* If "ENABLE CONTENT" appears in Access or "ENABLE MACROS" appears while running the program. Check the INITIAL SETTINGS section
of this document on how to fix the problem.
* If Access fails, make sure the FWD database has the appropriate tables shown in the REQUIREMENTS section of this document.
